Hello this my simple motor driver based on Ne555 timer to rapidly switch your motor on and off to slow it down.
its using ne555 and s9013 h331 trasistor to do the switching for us!
its also modular u can add more timers and more outputs as u want!
I made pcb version to so u can download gerber files here!
